		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Identify the odd one from these tags: (span), (p), (a), (i) and state the reason?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The odd tag in this grouping would be the (i) tag. This tag is used to define a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. In my opinion, this tag is odd in that I have never seen it used. I would assume that it is not very common for website to use voice functions and change the voices.
